# Commitment Document for DSPRO2 (FS24)

## Group Members

**Linus Schlumberger**
In this project, Linus is the person responsible for data collection. This additional step is not mandatory for this data science project, but we also want to learn how to create our own datasets and understand the problems and challenges associated with this task. Secondly, he is responsible for processing the unstructured data, such as the images needed for this process. This is a very important task, as it involves getting the images in the correct format and understanding how to access them to maximize their utility.

**Lukas Stöckli**
Lukas will be responsible for tracking the experiment throughout the entire process. This includes observing how the hyperparameters change the model output during the training, evaluation, and testing stages of the entire data pipeline. During model development, it is crucial for managing and documenting the steps taken by the team, comparing different models, tuning parameters, and selecting the best model. In addition to this major task, he is also responsible for project management. This involves managing tasks and timelines to maximize the project’s output within the given semester timeframe. It is important to maintain a balance in the team to work consistently on the project but not too much at once, in order to sustain the team spirit in a sustainable way.

**Yutaro Sigrist**
Yutaro is responsible for the Cloud Service aspect of the project. He will compare different solutions available in today’s market and decide which service we will use for the project. His responsibilities also include deciding which parts of the data pipeline will be used on the cloud service platform, and which parts will run locally. Therefore, it is mandatory for him to have an overview of the project’s infrastructure. He will also be responsible for managing the project’s infrastructure, keeping track of costs, usage, monitoring them, and creating reports on the project’s status after reaching various milestones.
